<h2>📝 Project Objective 📝</h2>

1. The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of kidney stone prediction, focusing on understanding the underlying factors that contribute to kidney stone formation and predicting the likelihood of kidney stone occurrence in patients.<br>
2. The project aims to analyze various urinary characteristics of patients in order to uncover patterns and insights related to kidney stone formation. By examining features such as urine gravity, pH, osmolality, conductivity, urea, and calcium levels, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological factors associated with kidney stone risk.<br>
